Last Sprint tackled the Create and Read functionalities, which were successfully merged into the main branch. We were also able to implement favorited recipes. This sprint will focus on 3 major things: update, delete, and search features. 
## Discussion
1. CRUD feature implementation, read and create functionality mostly completed
   - connecting frontend to backend
     - update should fetch recipe from local storage and update with new information

2. Search functionality, backend and frontend
3. Documentation for all the code written over the weekend
