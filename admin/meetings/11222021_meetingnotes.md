## Summary of Last Meeting
Friday's meeting was cancelled in place of a team-wide sprint. Our main focus on Friday's sprint was to get CRUD functionality implemented, both on frontend and backend. A second sprint was also held on Sunday, where we fully completed CRUD functionality as well as searching for recipes on our application. Overall, the sprints were incredibly successful and we are currently on track to finishing the project!
## Discussion
1. What comes next after CRUD features?
   - bug testing/bug fixing
   - E2E and unit testing
   - site redesign, current design needs an update
     - figma redesign before attempting to add CSS to the app
     - colors, fonts, upgrading general look and feel, etc.
     - responsiveness for different devices
   - domain specific features
     - recipe scaling
     - recipe sharing
    - consider adding a few more features, if time persists
## Additional Info
No additional info.
## Adjournment
